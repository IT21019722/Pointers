# Pointers

## Activity 1

float number1 = 6.2;  
float number2 = 7.3;  
1. Define the variable fPtr to be a pointer to a variable of type float.  
2. Assign the address of variable number1 to pointer variable fPtr.  
3. Print the value of the object pointed to by fPtr.  
4. Assign the value of the variable pointed to by fPtr to variable number2.  
5. Print the value of number2.  
6. Print the address of number1.  
7. Print the address stored in fPtr. Is the value printed the same as the address of number1?  

## Activity 2

1. Declare two float type variables num1 and num2.  
2. Get an input from the user and assign the input to the variable num2.  
3. Declare two pointer variables.  
4. Assign the address of variable num1 and num2 to pointer variables.  
5. Add 7.8 to the num1 (num1 should be accessed using pointers).  
6. Subtract 14.2 from num2 (num1 should be accessed using pointers).  
7. Print the values of num1 and num2 using pointers.  
8. Add num1 and num2 and display the answer.
